# Miguel Gon√ßalves
As a Software Engineer, I always try to improve my knowledge of technology in general, with a particular interest in Software Development. Therefore, I intend to become a Full-Stack Developer, capable of creating any application inside and out. Although technology receives some negative reviews, I have always believed that it has the power to connect people and change the world and society for the better. How many problems in different areas are solved daily thanks to technological advances? Countless! This is my motivation for waking up early every morning: for every problem the world has, there is always a solution to be discovered. My job is to find it, whatever it takes!

## About Me
I am a Full Stack Developer with strong knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have experience working with frameworks such as React, Bootstrap, and TailwindCSS. Additionally, I am proficient in MySQL and MongoDB databases and have experience with DevOps tools like Docker and CI/CD.

## Hobbies
In my free time, I like to jog, work out in the gym, study other skills of software development, or other ones like Digital Marketing, Entrepreneurship, etc. I also like to play guitar; I really love hard rock music.
